Doc and screenshots on the website: https://whatsdiff.app

### What's New

#### ü§ñ MCP Server Integration

whatsdiff now includes a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**, enabling AI assistants to intelligently analyze your dependencies with tools for finding compatible versions, fetching release notes, discovering upgrades, and analyzing dependency constraints.

#### üñ•Ô∏è New Terminal UI

The Terminal UI (TUI) command provides an interactive way to browse changelogs and release notes for your dependencies directly in your terminal. Navigate through packages, view detailed release notes, and get insights on changes with ease.

#### üìã whatsdiff changelog

View aggregated release notes for any package version range. whatsdiff fetches from multiple sources with intelligent fallback: local CHANGELOG.md files, GitHub Releases API, and repository changelog files, with support for Deprecated, Removed, and Security sections.

#### ‚úÖ whatsdiff check

Perfect for CI/CD pipelines - verify if specific packages changed with exit codes (0 for true, 1 for false, 2 for errors) and quiet mode for script-friendly output.
